# Big-Two-Java

A Java-based card game with a GUI and Networking Elements.

This project includes key OOP features such as inheritance and abstraction and also makes use of various features of the Java programming language. 
It includes a fully-functional GUI to support easy user-interaction and gameplay, and uses Swing for this purpose.
It is implemented with a 4-player game in mind, and therefore includes an online multiplayer mechanic using Sockets to support multiplayer gameplay.
Online communication is also facilitated by means of a fully-functional chatbox which allows players to send text messages to each other.

The application can be run by first running the `GameServer` class, and then starting 4 `GameClient` instances to play the game.
